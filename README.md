### Project-Specific Adaptations:
1. **File Zipper**
   - Emphasize compression ratios/algorithms
   - Add security features (password protection?)

2. **Metro/Flight Route System**
   - Highlight graph algorithms (Dijkstra/A*)
   - Mention data sources (OpenStreetMap?)

3. **Splitting System**
   - Clarify file/partition splitting logic
   - Add parallel processing capabilities

4. **Sudoku Solver**
   - Explain algorithm (backtracking/constraint propagation)
   - Show example grid input/output

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Detail token bucket/leaky bucket implementation
   - Mention Redis/memcached integration

6. **Tiny URL**
   - Explain encoding scheme (base62)
   - Show URL shortening/expansion workflow

7. **Travel Planner**
   - Highlight itinerary optimization algorithms
   - Mention integration with APIs (Google Maps?)

---

### Additional Recommendations:
1. Add screenshots/diagrams for complex systems
2. Include benchmarking/performance results
3. Add contribution guidelines if open-source
4. Include environment variables/dependencies
5. Add roadmap/future features section
